<p>
            The game takes place in a illegal science lab. You must collect 3 fuel canisters to fuel the generator whilst evading or shooting the harsh abominations that were crated in the 
            lab. Whilst you have the choice to go the violent route to hold them back, you have limited ammunition and may be required to go the stealthy route by using vents located around the map.
            Ammunition will also be found around the map but not in high quantaties.
