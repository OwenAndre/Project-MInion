        <div class="Box3"> <font color="ffffff" > <p> <h2> Backstory </h2> </p> The player wakes up in a cell. which had been abandoned after one of the experiments escaped their containment 
            and had not been recontained. The security had failed and most likely been devoured by the monster or ran for their life. It is known that one scientist had escaped and used up most of the 
            gasoline before leaving. </font></div>
        <div class="Box4"> <font color="ffffff" > <p> <h2> What is the monster? </h2></p>
             The monster is low to the ground which can make it difficult for the player to see unless they are trying to spot the monster. Whilst the monster
            can't be killed, it can be stunned with the gun for a few seconds to allow the player to run. |It will instantly kill the player which will force the player to try to stay safe or attempt
            risky moves to get to where they need to reach such as jumping over the monster. The hitbox of the monster will be smaller to allow the player to attempt to do this.
        </font> </div>
        <div class="Box5"> <font color="ffffff" > <p> <h2> How do you win? </h2> </p>
                The player wins by collecting the 3 fuel canisters and putting the fuel into the generator to open the final door in order to escape.
        </font> </div> 
        <div class="Box6"> <font color="ffffff" > <p> <h2> What does the map look like? </h2> </p>
            The map has a hallway which is in the shape of a square. A room is in the center and more rooms branch off from the hallway.
        </font> </div>
        <div class="Box7"> <font color="ffffff" > <p> <h2> What are the mechanics? </h2> </p>
            <p> At the moment, the player can sprint by holding shift but I may add a stamina system to try to keep the stealth aspect </p>
            <p> Vents can be found around the map and the player can hide in them to prevent the monster from finding them.</p>
        </font> </div>
        <div class="Box8"> <font color="ffffff"> <p> <h2> What defence does the player have? </h2> </p>
            <p> The player has a gun which can stun the monster for a few seconds. Ammo is also limited and can be found around the map just like the batteries can. It isn't the best method of getting
                around the map and might be more effecient to use stealth.
